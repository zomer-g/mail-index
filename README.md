# mail-index
This Google Apps Script indexes new emails from Gmail, creates subfolders in Google Drive for attachments, and logs email details in a Google Sheet. Users provide Google Sheet and Drive folder IDs upon execution, making it flexible and easily shareable. The script processes emails in chronological order, starting from the oldest.
